## Key Features

- **Zone Creation**  
  Define custom zones by dropping a pin on a map or entering an address. Set the desired radius around each zone and visualize it with intuitive map markers and radius circles. Each zone configuration is saved, allowing users to revisit and interact with their zones effortlessly.

- **Real-Time Location Tracking**  
  Radius provides accurate, efficient location tracking. Users can adjust location accuracy preferences to balance battery efficiency with precision, catering to both active and casual use.

- **Friend Profile and Zone Interaction**  
  Dive into friend profiles to explore shared zones, view activities, and connect through zones. The app’s UI showcases zones with visual flair, such as animated gradient borders, making interactions more enjoyable.

- **Competitions and Leaderboards**  
  Engage in friendly competition! Radius supports group competitions by tracking zone exits and awarding points based on exit order. Leaderboards update dynamically, allowing users to view their standing in real time.

- **Dynamic Notifications**  
  Receive notifications when leaving a zone, with details on the specific zone and exit time. The app opens directly to relevant views when notifications are tapped, enhancing user experience and engagement.

- **Customization**  
  Radius offers a range of customization options, from gradient styling to profile and zone layout designs, allowing users to personalize the app to their preferences.

## How It Works

1. **Create Your Zone**  
   Open the zone editor and either drop a pin or type an address to set your location. Adjust the radius to your preference, name the zone, and save it.

2. **Track Exits and Leaderboards**  
   Track your zone activity with intelligent exit detection. Each time you leave a zone, Radius logs the event, updating leaderboards with points based on exit timing. Users in groups or competitions can view a real-time leaderboard and compare standings.

3. **Stay Connected with Friends**  
   With Radius, friends and family are just a zone away. Add friends, view their zones, and explore shared areas. The app supports easy friend requests, allowing users to manage connections in one place.

4. **Debug Menu and Advanced Features**  
   For power users, Radius includes a debug menu to monitor zone statuses, events, and performance, ensuring seamless operation and enhanced insight.

## Technology Stack

- **iOS Development**: Built with SwiftUI, leveraging Core Location for geofencing.
- **Database**: Supabase-powered backend for real-time data synchronization and storage.
- **Data Management**: Integrated Core Data for efficient storage and retrieval of user and zone information.
